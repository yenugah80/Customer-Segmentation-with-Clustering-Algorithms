# GROUP5-Customer-Segmentation-with-Clustering-Algorithms

Objective
The objective of this assignment is to develop students' ability to apply machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering, to real-world business problems. Students will enhance their skills in data preprocessing, determining the optimal number of clusters, and interpreting the results of clustering analysis. Additionally, students will learn to translate data-driven insights into actionable business strategies, a critical skill in leveraging machine learning for business decision-making.

Instructions
Instructions
In this assignment, you will apply your understanding of the different clustering algorithms to perform customer segmentation. Using a provided dataset that includes customer purchase information, your task is to identify distinct customer groups based on their buying behaviors. Once segments are identified, analyze these groups to recommend specific marketing strategies tailored to each segment's characteristics.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes various features such as frequency of purchases, total spending, and categories of products bought by customers. Ensure you explore and understand the data before applying the clustering algorithm.

Steps to Complete the Assignment
Preprocess the data: Handle any missing values, normalize features if necessary, and prepare the dataset for clustering.
Choose the number of clusters: Use methods such as the elbow method or silhouette analysis to determine an appropriate number of clusters (k).
Apply clustering: Implement the algorithm and assign customers to clusters.
Analyze the results: Examine the characteristics of each cluster and visualize your findings using relevant plots.
Suggest marketing strategies: Based on cluster analysis, propose targeted marketing strategies for each group.
